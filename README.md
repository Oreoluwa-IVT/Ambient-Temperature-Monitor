# Temperature with DHT 22 Sensors
We simply read Ambient temperature from a DHT 22 Temperature sensor and display it on an LCD. With a resolution of (16x2) specifically. We also put in place a few modules to help us get regulated power supply.
Breadboarding and circuit diagram will be included late on
(fork this repo and run the "Ecobag" Arduino file on your Arduiono IDE)
